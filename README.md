# Music-Genre-Recommendation
this repository contains the project of my FRT microsoft internship
I Used Python Language and Libraries.
We will develop a Machine learning model to study the effect of (age, gender) input variables on (genre) output variables, which recommends user the genre of music he/she may prefer to listen.
It is the working model in Machine Learning.
I used Desicion Tree Classifier Algorithm to Fit and train the model.
It takes any input Values in Ages and gender in 0 and 1 (0- Female, 1- Male).
It is Not Underfit and overfit
Also highly Accurate.
